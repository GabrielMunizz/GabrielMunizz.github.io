      <h1>FullBio</h1>
      <p>After 10 years working in business administration, I've decided to explore my passion for technology and embark on a new professional journey. In 2019, I've made a decision to take a break and reflect on my goals and interests
         During this period, I've realized that my affinity for technology, especially through gaming, could be more than just a hobby. With determination and motivation, I immersed myself in independent studies and became even more fascinated by the world of programming.
         That's when I heard about Trybe, an innovative and renowned school that shapes complete developers and prepares them for the job market. Since then, I've decided to embrace this opportunity and fully dive into the programming world.
         Today, I'm excited to leverage my background in administration and my passion for technology to add value to an innovative company. I'm ready to face challenges, learn continuously, and contribute to projects and team growth.
         If you're looking for a dedicated and versatile professional who is passionate about technology, let's talk! I'm open to opportunities that allows me to apply my knowledge and contribute to the success of challenging projects.
